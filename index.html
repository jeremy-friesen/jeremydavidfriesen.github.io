    <h3>
      My interest in programming began with a video game called 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LittleBigPlanet_2">LittleBigPlanet 2</a>, a game about making levels and
      sharing them with your friends. The game featured tools to build 2D environments and logic to
      interact with them. Being a kid at the time, I was excited to have the tools to make my own games. The level
      creator was robust and logical, intuitive yet challenging; I was enamored by the problem-solving and creative
      process it required. Although the game did not require any code to be written, it undoubtedly inspired a
      love for logic and set me on a path of computer enthusiasm and the pursuit of programming knowledge.

    <h3>
      In grade 10 I enrolled in a class called 'Introduction to Computer Studies' where we learned a 
      pretty-much-useless-yet-kinda-fun programming language called 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(programming_language)">Turing</a>. Now introduced to the
      magical superpower of writing code, my brain came alive thinking of all the possibilities. Over the course
      of grade 11's programming class which also used Turing, I went wild with my awful spaghetti code and made 
      <a href="https://youtu.be/m2hP7Rm76I8">Box Man</a>, a hectic platformer with a darn-good level creator, if
      I do say so myself. The code was awful, and the game runs as fast as your processor lets it, making it
      ridiculously fast on any computer that isn't the old windows XP it was built on, but that assignment made me
      sure that programming is what I wanted to do with my life.
